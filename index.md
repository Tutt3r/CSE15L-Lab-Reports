Step one is to go to the microsoft website and install the file [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


next, run the file

the wizard should walk you through the next steps

When complete it should look like this

Go ahead and open the terminal in VS Code

Then simply punch in your CSE15L account email

You will then be prompted to enter your password

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, my account doesnt function

Here are the commands I was able to Run locally

This command lists available directories

And the command cd changes the current directory

# Technical Difficulties
My computer is able to connect and recognize my CSE account but unfortunately rejects my password

Assuming this was working I would be describing changing directories but instead I am providing a screenshot of a broken sign in

Update: I was for a time able to sign in and access my account but I no longer can again.  I need to contact ITS
